# 👋 Welcome to $HOMEChain

**HomeChain** is a Layer 1 blockchain protocol built for the **Home Mining Revolution**.

Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which require specialized hardware (ASICs/GPUs) to validate, $HOMEChain is designed from the ground up to run on **Consumer Hardware**—laptops, desktops, Raspberry Pis, and even Android phones.

### 💡 The Vision: "Ubiquitous Validation"
We believe that true decentralization is only possible when *everyone* can run a node and mine blocks.
*   **No ASICs**: Optimized for general-purpose CPUs.
*   **No Pre-mine**: Fair launch, 100% community owned.
*   **No ICO**: Value is determined by work, not venture capital.

### 🔑 Key Features
| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Consensus** | **Proof of Work (PoW)** using a CPU-optimized SHA256 variant. |
| **Supply** | **21 Billion** $HOME (Micro-transaction ready). |
| **Emission** | **Geometric Decay**: 50-Year Mining Schedule. |
| **Language** | Written in **Python 100%** for maximum readability and transparency. |
