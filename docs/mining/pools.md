# Mining Pools

*Currently, $HOMEChain only supports Solo Mining.*

## What is Solo Mining?
You run your own miner against your own node (or a public seed node).
*   **Pros**: You keep 100% of the block reward (132,575 $HOME).
*   **Cons**: Variance. You might mine for days without finding a block, then find two in a row.

## Pool Support (Coming Soon)
We are developing a **Stratum V1** compatible pool server. This will allow:
1.  Miners to combine hashpower.
2.  Receive consistent, smaller payouts (shares).
